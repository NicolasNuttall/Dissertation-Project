          <h3>DEMONS (1876)</h3>
          <p class="author-name">By Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
          <p class="book-description">
            Dostoevsky conceived the idea of Crime and Punishment, prompted by
            the case of Pierre Fran√ßois Lacenaire, in the summer of
            1865.[citation needed] He had been working on another project at the
            time entitled The Drunkards, which was to deal with "the present
            question of drunkenness ... [in] all its ramifications, especially
            the picture of a family and the bringing up of children in these
            circumstances, etc., etc." This theme, centering on the story of the
            Marmeladov family, became ancillary to the story of Raskolnikov and
            his crime.[7]
